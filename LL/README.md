# Linked List Data Structure Algorithms
Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. 
Linked list can be defined as the nodes that are randomly stored in the memory. 
A node in the linked list contains two parts, i.e., first is the data part and second is the address part. 
The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null. After array, linked list is the second most used data structure. 
In a linked list, every link contains a connection to another link.

## Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Circular Doubly Linked List
