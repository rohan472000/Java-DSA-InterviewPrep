# Graph Algorithms
A graph is a unique data structure in programming that consists of finite sets of nodes or vertices and a set of edges, 
that connect these vertices to them. At this moment, adjacent vertices can be called those vertices, 
that are connected to the same edge with each other. 
In simple terms, a graph is a visual representation of vertices and edges sharing some connection or relationship.

# Types of Graphs

- **Order:** Order defines the total number of vertices present in the graph.
- **Size:** Size defines the number of edges present in the graph.
- **Self-loop:** Self-loop refers to edges that connect a vertex to itself.
- **Isolated vertex:** An isolated vertex is a vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph.
- **Vertex degree:** Vertex degree is defined as the number of edges incident to a vertex in a graph.
- **Weighted graph:** A weighted graph is a graph where vertices have associated values or weights
- **Unweighted graph:** An unweighted graph is a graph where vertices have no associated values or weights.
- **Directed graph:** A directed graph is a graph where edges have a direction indicator,
  meaning they go from one vertex to another in a specific direction.
- **Undirected graph:** An undirected graph is a graph where edges have no specified direction;
  they simply connect two vertices without indicating a specific direction.
