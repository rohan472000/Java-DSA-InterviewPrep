# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
This is a collection of my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. These implementations are intended to help me learn and practice the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Data Structures
The following data structures are currently implemented in this repo:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Graph
- Hash Table
Each data structure has its own folder containing its implementation, along with relevant tests.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repo:

### Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
Each algorithm has its own folder containing its implementation, along with relevant tests.

## Usage
To use any of the implementations, clone this repo and import the relevant Java files into your project. Each implementation is self-contained in a single Java file, so it should be easy to use.

To run the tests for any implementation, navigate to its folder and run the relevant test file. For example, to run the tests for the Linked List implementation, navigate to the "linked-list" folder and run the "LinkedListTest.java" file.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to this repo! If you find a bug or have an improvement to suggest, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
