# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This is a collection of my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. These implementations are intended to help me learn and practice the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented in this repo:

- Array
- ArrayList
- Sorting
- String
- Linked List
- Stack
- Threads
- Queue
- Priority Queue
- Heap
- Hash Map
- Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph




 
Each data structure has its own folder containing its implementation, along with relevant tests.<br>
This repository also includes important LeetCode problems and mathematical content that is beneficial for understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repo:

### Sorting Algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Each algorithm has its own folder containing its implementation, along with relevant tests.

## Usage

To use any of the implementations, clone this repo and import the relevant Java files into your project. Each implementation is self-contained in a single Java file, so it should be easy to use.

To run the tests for any implementation, navigate to its folder and run the relevant test file. For example, to run the tests for the Linked List implementation, navigate to the "linked-list" folder and run the "LinkedListTest.java" file.
