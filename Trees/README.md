# Tree Data Structure Algorithms
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent & organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. 
It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. 
Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.

This section contains a lot of important algorithms that help us to use sorting algorithms in various scenarios.
