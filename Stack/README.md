# Stack Algorithms
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). 

LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

This section contains a lot of important algorithms that help us to use sorting algorithms in various scenarios.
