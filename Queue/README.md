# Queue Data Structure

A queue is another kind of linear data structure that is used to store elements, 
just like any other data structure but in a particular manner. 
In simple words, we can say that the queue is a type of data structure in the Java programming language that stores elements of the same kind. 
The components in a queue are stored in a FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior. 
There are two ends in the queue collection, i.e., front & rear. Queue has two ends that is front and rear.

This section contains a lot of important algorithms that help us to use sorting algorithms in various scenarios.

* Output Restricted Queue (this is also a Simple Queue)
* Circular Queue
* Double Ended Queue (Deque)
